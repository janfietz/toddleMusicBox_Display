toddlerMusicBoxControl
==========

As part of my [toddlerMusicBox]( http://janfietz.github.io/toddlerMusicBox) project i use a stm32f4-discovery board to control a NEOPIXEL LED strip and a MF RC522 based RFID reader.
The stm32f4-discovery provides a serial usb interface to get the current RFID Tag UID and to adjust LED effects.
